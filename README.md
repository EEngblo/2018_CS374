---------------------------
## Tasks

1.  Assume that you don’t want to concern about detailed knowledge at all. Make a composition with your own budget simply.
> (Hint : Why don’t you use ‘원 클릭’ mode?)

2.  Assume that you want to fully customize your new computer target on ‘game performance’. Make a composition with your own budget.
> (Hint : Why don’t you use ‘커스텀' and ‘게임 성능' mode)

3.  Assume that you often refer guide websites while gaming. Make a fully customized composition with your own budget.
> (Hint : Opening many websites with game consumes a lot of 'RAM' space and why don’t you use ‘커스텀’ and ‘활용도’ mode)
