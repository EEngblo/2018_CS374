## POV & Tasks

 **POV**
 -  We met a **moneyless gamer** who wants to **buy a computer, yet lacks background knowledge**
 -  We were amazed to realize that they **fall apart** when **given overflowing unfamiliar information.**
 -  It’d be game-changing to **provide a way to buy a computer that lets them do what they want to do without any concern.**

**Tasks**
1. Set specific budget and your favorite game
2. Read tutorials carefully and select which part—among Performance and Diverse functionality—do you consider more important
3. Within a given budget, make a complete composition of your new computer which can run your favorite game smoothly
